 

There were a couple of question on kind of preparation for ML and here is the summary for your reference

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression

3. Decision Trees

4. KNN

5. Random Forest and Ensembles (boosting, bagging and stacking)

 

For each of this algorithm, you may start with following

1. Does algorithm requires data in specific formats (completely categorical or numeric or both)

2. Basic working of the algorithm

3.  What is output model

4. How is the model interpreted

 

General Data Challenges

1. Class imbalance- If the target has levels with one level having more number of records that other level.

  - In such cases we generate synthetic samples in train data and method is known as SMOTE. In python we can use Imbalanced-learn

     For some algorithms such as SVM or logistic regression (particularly in python) we have parameter called weights where we can specify weights to minority and majority samples

 

2. More number of attributes- Dimensionality Reduction

3. More number of levels in categorical attributes- Reducing levels

 

General Preprocessing

-Standardization- How to perform it separately on train and test

-PCA - using predict function to get scores for both train and test

- Categorical to numeric and vice versa

 

Libraries:

Caret package- for grid search, preprocessing, cross validation, comparison of different methods etc. This package is very resourceful and you can explore it.

 

If we practice this, most of ML methods and techniques are covere
